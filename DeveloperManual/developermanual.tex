\section{Introduction}

Writing algorithm classes for ToureNPlaner consists of three easy steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Write an algorithm
  \item Write a factory that creates instances of that algorithm
  \item Register the factory in the algorithmregistry
\end{itemize}


  \subsection{Overview: How Algorithms in ToureNPlaner work}
  After a request from a client to the server has been received by netty server.AlgorithmHandler will do the following things:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item from the URL suffix \textit{/alg\textbf{myalg}} checks, whether there is an algorithm factory in the algorithm registry that provides \textbf{myalg} via the getURLSuffix() method
    \item if in private mode, writes the request to the database
    \item gives the request object (name of the algorithm, a responder object in which the result can be written, the data from the request) to the queue
  \end{itemize}
  Each ComputeThread (nondeterministically) takes a request object out of the queue, gets the correct algorithm factory from the algorithm manager via the algorithm suffix in the request and getURLSuffix() in the factory, starts the MyAlgorithm.compute() method, initiates writing of the response object (original way, calculated result way, misc information) back to netty.\\
  In MyAlgorithm compute(Computerequest req) is called. After the calculation is done MyAlgorithm should put the resulting way in the Points object acquired with req.getResulWay() and additional information in a misc object with req.setMisc(Object o).

\section{Detailed Steps}

  \subsection{How to write an Algorithm}

    \subsubsection{The algorithm class}
		A new Algorithm will almost surely inherit from the abstract GraphAlgorithm class (which implements the Algorithm interface). Only in the unlikely case that the new algorithm does not run on the graph it can directly implement the Algorithm interface.\\
		Algorithm (and GraphAlgorithm) is are very simple to implement: It only requires to implement the compute(ComputeRequest req) method.
		The req object allows to get the following information
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item The points the client sent: req.getPoints()
		  \item The constraints the client sent: req.getConstraints()
		\end{itemize}
		Now the actual algorithm can be implemented using this information.\\
		After calculating the result it should be returned to the client. Since java has no good mechanism to return arbitrary ``structs'' we decided to write the result directly into the response object.\\
		This information should be written:
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item the resulting way, into the Points object acquired by req.getResultWay()
		  \item optionally an arbitrary misc object as long as jackson can map it to json (for example, a Map): req.setMisc(Object o)
		\end{itemize}


	 \subsubsection{The factory class}
	 The factory class should inherit directly from AlgorithmFactory if the algorithm doesn't need the graph. If the algorithm works on the graph, it should either inherit from GraphAlgorithmFactory (which extends AlgorithmFactory) or from SharingAlgorithmFactory (which extends GraphAlgorithmFactory) depending on whether the algorithm uses \hyperref[sharing]{data structure sharing}.
	 Methods the factory needs to implement:
	 \begin{itemize}
	   \item createAlgorithm: returns a new instance of the algorithm
	   \item getDetails: returns a Map with the details that will be sent to the client with the serverinfo
	   \begin{itemize}
	     \item Convention: the ``hidden'' - boolean entry in the details causes the algorithm to not be displayed to the user in the clients
	   \end{itemize}
		\item getURLSuffix(): returns the suffix of the algorithm url that will be used. \textbf{/alg} will pre prefixed automatically. (Example: returning \textbf{sp} will result in the url for this algorithm be /alg\textbf{sp})
		\item getAlgName(): returns the complete name of the algorithm that will be displayed in the clients
		\item getVersion(): returns a version number for the algorithm
		\item getPointConstraints(): returns a list of constraints for the points
		\item getConstraints(): returns a list of global constraints for the algorithm
		\item isHidden(): returns whether the algorithm is ``hidden''. If true, algorithms will not be logged in the database when using a private server
	 \end{itemize}
	 
  \label{sharing}
  \subsection{Data Structure Sharing}
  An algorithm can share data structures with other algorithms on the same ComputeCore. An algorithm that uses data structure sharing receives a ``Resource Sharer'' of the type DijkstraStructs as parameter in its constructor. This ``Resource Sharer'' allows \textit{borrowing} from and \textit{returning} to a pool of data structures. The data structures are named after a specific purpose. While an array named ``DistArray'' is just an array of ints that does not enforce any usage, for the sake of clarity it is a good idea to use it to store distances.\\
  Currently those data structures are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Deque: IntArrayDeque (com.carrotsearch.hppc.IntArrayDeque)
    \item Heap: dynamically growing MinHeap of int
    \item DistArray: int array, size: \# of nodes, (re-)initialized with Integer.MAX\_VALUE every time it is \textit{return}ed, except when the returnDistArray() method is given alreadyReset = true as a parameter
    \item PrevArray: int array, size: \# of nodes
    \item VisitedSet: BitSet, size: \# of nodes
    \item MarkedSet: BitSet, size: \# of edges
  \end{itemize}
  Note: \textit{Borrowed} data structures need to be \textit{returned} in \textbf{every} possible code path including exception handling. If a data structure is \textit{borrowed} that has not been \textit{returned} before, an IllegalAccessException("Heap borrowed X again") will be thrown.

  \subsection{Finishing steps}
  The algorithm factory needs to be \textit{registered} in the AlgorithmRegistry. This is also the place to pass the graph to the algorithm.
  In the server.TourenPlaner class do:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=java,caption=register your algorithm factory]
          reg.registerAlgorithm(new MyAlgorithmFactory(graph));
  \end{lstlisting}
