\section{Introduction}
To compute routes and tour on a street network ToureNPlaner needs to have a memory representation of the street network as 
a graph where each edge represents a section of a road (two edges in oppisite direction for a street that can be traveled in both directions).
To load new street networks into the ToureNPlaner server we use a text based representation of the graph.
This representation is described in this document so that graphs in this format can be generated and loaded into ToureNPlaner.

\section{Basics}
The graph file format used by ToureNPlaner is a text based representation of a graph with additional data on the nodes (e.g. coordinates)
and edges (e.g. travel time).
It uses the file ending ``.txt'' and is encoded in ASCII/UTF-8 with line-feed (Unix) line endings (though Windows line endings will work).

\section{Structure}
Each graph file has the following three sections
\begin{itemize}
 \item Header
 \item Nodes
 \item Edges
\end{itemize}

\section{Section Descriptions}
\subsection{Conventions}
To describe the format we use place holders of the form 
\begin{verbatim}
<placeholdername>                                                         
\end{verbatim}
place holder name which need to replaced with
actual values.

\subsection{Header}
The header consits of two lines:
\begin{verbatim*}
<numNodes>
<numEdges>
\end{verbatim*}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 
 \textbf{numNodes} the number of nodes in the graph as a decimal number string e.g. ``14505''
 \item
 \textbf{numEdges} the number of edges in the graph (including shortcuts if Contraction Hierarchies is used) e.g. ``59600''
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Nodes}
The nodes section consists of number of nodes lines with each line describing a node of the graph in the following way.
Not that each node has an implicit node id that is it's position in this file so the first nodes line
represents node 0, the second node 1 and so on.
\begin{verbatim*}
<latitude> <longitude> <height> <nodeRank>
\end{verbatim*}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{latitude} the geographical latitude of the node times $10^7$ e.g. ``484878025'' for ``48.4878025 N''
\item \textbf{longitude} the geographical longitude of the node times $10^7$ e.g. ``91901961'' for ``9.1901961 E''
\item \textbf{height} the height (geographical elevation above NN) in meters
\item \textbf{nodeRank} the Contraction Hierachy rank of the node (optional if no Contraction Hierachy is used) if the
CH hasn't been computed completely all uncontracted nodes must have their rank set to 32 bit signed int maximum ($2^{31} - 1$) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Edges}
The edges section consits of number of edges lines with each line describing an edge of the graph ordered by ascending source id
\begin{verbatim*}
<sourceId> <targetId> <length> <euclidianDist> <shortcuttedId1> <shortcuttedId2>
\end{verbatim*}

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{sourceId} the node id of the source node of this edge
 \item \textbf{targetId} the node id of the target node of this edge
 \item \textbf{length} the length of this edge, this length property is used during shortest path computation and
 can be weighted to compensate for the speedlimit on the real world street
 \item \textbf{euclidianDist} die euclidian (great circle) length of this edge in meters used to compute the real length of the paths
 \item \textbf{shortcuttedId1} if this edge is a Contraction Hierachy shortcuted this is the edge id (position in the edge list starting from 0) of the
 first edge shortcutted by this edge. If this is not a shortcut it must be -1
 \item \textbf{shortcuttedId2} if this edge is a Contraction Hierachy shortcuted this is the edge id (position in the edge list starting from 0) of the
 second edge shortcutted by this edge. If this is not a shortcut it must be -1
\end{itemize}
